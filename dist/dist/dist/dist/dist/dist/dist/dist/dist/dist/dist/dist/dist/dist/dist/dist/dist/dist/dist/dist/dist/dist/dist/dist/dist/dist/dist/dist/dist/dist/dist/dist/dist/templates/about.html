<p class = 'about-text'>This project's for educational purposes
  the original website is <a href="https://soundcloud.com/">Soundcloud</a> <br>

  As a front end developer, companies may give us photoshoped images and ask us to build them,<br>
  that's why i treid to rebuild a famouse website ,<br>
  in this project i used:<br>
  * <em>Bootstrap</em> for the foundations <br>
  * <em>Jquery</em><br>
  * <em>Wavesurfer library</em> for the audio and for showing the wave form<br>
  * <em>Css animation</em><br>

  I tried to keep my code dry , I had one HTML page and a Javascript file 'outside the angular' where the<br>
  library's function was set up .<br>

  Every view has a functional directive that uses one HTML Template and it's own<br>
  controller.<br>

<br>
  Hope you like it ,
